##  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Mike
I'm a graduate of **Udacity**'s _FrontEnd Web Developer NanoDegree_ program and have built projects using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** _and_ **REACT**. I am learning about static site generators (SSG) and reading about *Liquid.JS* and *Nunjucks*.

I am curious about the future and the past of the web and continue to be inspired and surprised by all that I learn about the subject.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently building a basic blog site using **11ty**
